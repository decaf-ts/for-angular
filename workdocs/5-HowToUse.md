## Coding Principles

- group similar functionality in folders (analog to namespaces but without any namespace declaration)
- one class per file;
- one interface per file (unless interface is just used as a type);
- group types as other interfaces in a types.ts file per folder;
- group constants or enums in a constants.ts file per folder;
- group decorators in a decorators.ts file per folder;
- always import from the specific file, never from a folder or index file (exceptions for dependencies on other packages);
- prefer the usage of established design patters where applicable:
  - Singleton (can be an anti-pattern. use with care);
  - factory;
  - observer;
  - strategy;
  - builder;
  - etc;
